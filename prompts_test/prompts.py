Your objective is to intercept an evading spacecraft in orbit by applying discrete thrust commands in three directions: forward (ft), right (rt), and down (dt).

At every time step, you will receive:
- Pursuer position: (x, y, z) [meters]
- Pursuer velocity: (vx, vy, vz) [m/s]
- Remaining vehicle mass and monopropellant
- Evader position and velocity
- Prograde vector (direction of motion)

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the **relative position and velocity** between pursuer and evader.
2. **Reason step-by-step** how to maneuver efficiently to reduce the gap.
3. Consider fuel usage and avoid overshooting when distance is small.
4. Follow this policy:
   - For the first 15 seconds: pursue aggressively and reduce distance.
   - When distance < 1000 meters: slow down and match velocity.
   - Always match both position and velocity gradually.
   - Avoid unnecessary propellant usage.

Respond in two parts:
1. First, output your **reasoning** in clear steps (Chain-of-Thought).
2. Then, return a **valid JSON** dictionary containing your thrust decision:

  "ft": -1 | 0 | 1,
  "rt": -1 | 0 | 1,
  "dt": -1 | 0 | 1

- Your remaining mass and propellant
- The evader's position and velocity
- Your prograde vector (direction of motion)

Think step by step:
1. Compute the relative position (Δx, Δy, Δz) and relative velocity (Δvx, Δvy, Δvz).
2. Determine if the pursuer is approaching too fast (Δv large and negative).
3. If distance > 1000 m and mission time < 15 s → focus on aggressive closing.
4. If distance < 1000 m → **prioritize braking** and aligning velocities to avoid overshooting.
5. Use negative thrust (ft, rt, dt = -1) if relative velocity is too negative and distance is short.
6. Avoid unnecessary thrust in directions with already low relative error.
7. Choose a discrete thrust command as a JSON.

Valid actions:

- The position and velocity of both pursuer and evader
- The mass and remaining propellant of the pursuer

Follow this reasoning structure before giving your decision:

Step 1: Calculate the difference in position and velocity between the pursuer and evader.
Step 2: Assess whether the pursuer is approaching or diverging from the evader.
Step 3: Determine the required direction of thrust in each axis (ft, rt, dt).
Step 4: Evaluate fuel usage and timing constraints.
Step 5: Choose the most efficient action that balances approach speed and fuel consumption.
